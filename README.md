# Python


Welcome to my personal repository for learning Python through hands-on projects!

My name is Aditya, and I'm a second-year computer science student. This space is my workshop where I'll be building a series of small, practical projects to master the fundamentals of Python, with a long-term focus on AI and Machine Learning.

### What You'll Find Here

This repository will contain a collection of my completed projects, showcasing my journey from the basics to more complex applications. Each project is a new lesson and a step forward in my learning.

* **Current Focus:** Building foundational command-line applications.

This repository is my commitment to the idea of "learning by building." Each commit is another step towards my ultimate goal: Project V.I.S.H.N.U.

### Let's Connect

I'm always open to learning and connecting with others on a similar path.
